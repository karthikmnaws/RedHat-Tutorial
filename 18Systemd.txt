
						Systemd
					  ===================

- Lets say we have 10 Dependencies, CheckConfig		| | | | | | | | | | 	all are up and running.
	We assumed all are running, suppose if any are not running, we have to stop service, and make all dependencies to run.
	But this need high technical knowledge.

- This is the reason systemctl bought
		     --------

- systemctl <enable> <s/h>		// systemctl enables systemd.
	from 0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0
	to   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
	    pid pid pid pid pid pid pid pid pid pid
 	    ---------------------------------------
				|
				|
			       root			These pid's is connected to root.

- systemctl start <s/h>
	Now while startingi, if any dependencies not running, we came to know at begining itself.

- Deamon
  --------
	It is a type of program in Unix like O.S that runs without stopage in the background rather than under the control of an user waiting to be 
	activated by the occurance of the specific unit.
	They are initiated by the process. Background Process for a service or an application is called a Deamon.

- Service
  ---------
	It is a combination of one or more Deamons which contineously runs in the background. A user always interacts with the service.
	init Deamon is replaced by systemd Deamon.

	init is a Deamon process which starts as soon the computer starts and continue running till it is shutdown.
	It is a first process to start and has a pId if 1.

- Difference between systemd and init
  -----------------------------------

1) init is used to start up only one process at a time during booting, where as systemd initiates multiple independence services simultaneously.

2) In init, strting of individual Deamon of a service is not possible, we have to start entire service, where as in systemd individual Deamons
    can be started without having started the entire service.

3) systemd provides automatic service dependency management, where if any independent service fails, it remembers and avoides the 
    restarting of services again and again.

- chkconfig <Service name> <on/off>
- service <service name> <enable / disable / start>


- init Scripts or run levels
  --------------------------

init 0 => shut down
init 1 => Single user mode
init 2 => multiuser with CLI mode and without network.
init 3 => full multiuser with CLI mode
init 4 => not used
init 5 => multiuser with GUI
init 6 => restart / reboot

- systemctl
  ---------
	This command is a central management tool for  controlling the init systems.

- systemd
  --------
	This is an init system and the purpose of this is to initialize all the components, that must be started after the Kernal has booted.

- systemctl <enable / start / stop / disable> <service name>

LOAD   = Reflects whether the unit definition was properly loaded.
ACTIVE = The high-level unit activation state, i.e. generalization of SUB.
SUB    = The low-level unit activation state, values depend on unit type.

13 loaded units listed. Pass --all to see loaded but inactive units, too.
To show all installed unit files use 'systemctl list-unit-files'.
