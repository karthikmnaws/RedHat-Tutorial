									    ===========

- Links are mainly used to provide either data accessability or data Redundency.
- There are 2 major types of links
	* Soft Links
	* Hard Links

- Software Links
  --------------
	Soft Links can be created on both Files and Directories where in the Link file doesn't contain the actual data. 
	It contains only the path to the source file.
	Syntax:
		ln -s <filename> <new link name>
	Note:1) inode number is same for created link as well
	     2) Link file should always be a new file name
	     3) If the source file is deleted the data cannot be access from the link

- Hardware Links
  --------------
	It can be created only for file, not for the directories
	Any data updated to source file will be updated to the destination and vice versa
	In case of Hard Link, if the source file is deleted the data can be access using link file.
	Here inode number is different
	Syntax:
		ln <filename> <new linkname>
