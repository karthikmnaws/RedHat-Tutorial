
								Security Enhanced Linux (SELinux)
							=================================================
							        (Top Priority in Enhancing Security)

- Context in SE Linux
	* User
	* Role
	* Type
	* Sensitivity

- Consider a file1, assigning role context
		Manager = r - -
		T.L	= r w -
		Agents  = r - -

- Modes of OS
  ----------
	Enforcing Mode
	Permissive Mode
	Disabled Mode

  While booting, Stop in Enforcing mode, assigning above rules [ Manager,TL,Agents ] to Roles.

 Setting Context in doing in O.S
	 Modes    in my machine

- SE Linux
	It is a additional layer of system security, primary goal of SE Linux is to protect user data from system services that have been compramised.
  SE Linux is the set of security rules that determines which process can access which files directives and ports. Every process files, directories,
 and ports has a special label called SELinux context.

- Types of Context are
 1. User
 2. Roles
 3. Type
 4. Sencitivity
	And the default context is 'Type' context.

Modes in SE Linux are
=====================
1. Enforcing
  ==========
	SE Linux actively denies access to web Servers attempting to read files with temp_t type context.
	In this mode SELinix both logs and protects '1'.

2. Permissive
  ===========
	It is often used in trouble shooting purpose, In this mode SE Liux allows the instructions even if their as any explecit rules and it Logs those
	instructions. Numerical value is '0'.

3. Dissabled
   ==========
	Here SE Linux is completely disabled.

- Hirerarchy of Permission
  ======================
	1. SE Linux
	2. Firewall
	3. SCL
	4. chmod

- $ touch file1
- $ ls -z file1		// To display SE Linux Context
- $ getenforce		// To check SE Linux mode
- $ setenforce 0	// To change
- $ setenforce 1	// To set to Enforce Mode

- To Change to Dissable mode
$ vim /etc/sysconfig/selinux
	SELINUX = disabled		// We can type to change any mode like Enforce, Permissive, Dissabled

- $ reboot		// only for Default mode
- $ getenforce
	Dissabled
