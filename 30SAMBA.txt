
								SAMBA Server
								============

- SAMBA server is used to share directories over the network, it is a user based authentication server.
- Difference between NFS and SAMBA are
* NFS is host based authentication server, where as samba is user based authentication server.
* In NFS we share only files and directories, where as in samba along with Files and directories we can also share printer devices
* NFS provides insecure encrytions
