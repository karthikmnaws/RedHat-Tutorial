							=========================


- Archiving and compressing files are usefull when creating backups and transfering data accross the network.
- Syntax:
	tar -cvf <filename.tar> <files to be compressed>

- 3 Types of Compression are
	* gzip
	* bzip
	* xzzip

- gzip( gun zip )
  --------------
  * It uses deflate algorithm
  * It maintains the compression ratio for lower sized files and it looses the compression ratio, if file size becomes bigger.
  * If we compress and de-compress a files many times, their is a chances of data loss.
  * Compression/decompression is very fact and it is compatable with all types of linux OS
  * Syntax
	 $ tar -cvzf <filename.tar.gz> <files to be compresed>
	 To Compress

	 $ tar -xzf <filename.tar.gz>
	 To DeCompress

- bzip or bun zip
  --------------
  * Manitains a compress ratio even for bigger files.
  * It uses burrow's whealer's Algorithm
  * Greater compression ratio at the cost of longer compression time and memory required is more compared to gzip.
  * Syntax	
	$ tar -cvjf <filename.tar.bz2> <file to be compressed>
	TO Compress

	$ tar -xjf <filename.tar.bz2>

- xz zip
  ------
  * It uses LZMA2 Algorithm.
  * Greater compressor ratio, lesser disk space for small sized files.
  * Time and memory requirement is more.
  * Drawback is, it is not compatable with any linux O.S other than Redhat
  * Syntax
	$ tar -cvfJ <filename.tar.xz> <file to be compressed>
	
	$ tar -xJf <filename.tar.xz>

- Options are
	c = create
	v = verbose
	f = file
	x = extract
       -t = to list the contents of compressed files.
	z = gzip compression
	j = bzip compression
	J = xzzip compression
