- As soon as we press start button, Our OS detects detects the Source of the Hardware, Boot Loader is a Software which detects Hardware,
  Then Master Boot Recorder [MBR] contains the Data of Hard Disk, these MBR use for Partition of Hard disk,
  kernal fetchs all the Data inside the MBR, Basically the function of Kernal is, inputs given by the user is given to the shell, here input is converted to
  Machine language by kernal and finally kernal gets the output from Shell and pass the information to Hard Disk,
  init script initializes all the files for booting process, and finally all the mounting the partition is from /etc/fstab



- Machine is Powered On, System Firmware runs a Power On Self Test [POST] and starts to initialize some of the hardware.
- System Firmware searchs for a bootable device either configured in UEFI Boot Firmware or by searchs MBR on all discs.
- System Firmware reads a boot loader from discs, then passes control of the boot loader. Typically GRUB2 [Grand Unified Boot Loader].
- The boot loader loads its config from discs and present the user with a menu of possible configurations to boot.

	/etc/grub.d
	/etc/default/grub
	/boot/grub2/grub.cfg
	
- After the users has made choice the boot loader loads the configured kernal and initramfs from discs and places them in memory using
	/etc/dracut.conf

- The Boot loader hands over the control system to the kernal passing in any options specified in the kernal command line in the boot loader, 
  The kernal initializes all the hardware for which it can find a driver in initramfs and executes /sbin/init as PId1

- The systemd instances from the initramfs executes all units for the initrd the target, this includes mounting the actual boot system on/sysroot using /etc/fstab

- The kernal root file system is switched from initramfs root file system to the system root file system that was previously mounted on/sysroot.

- systemd looks for a default target either passed from  kernal command line and starts all the units to complain with the configurations for that 
  target solving dependencies between the unix automatically.

- /etc/systemd/system/default.target
	It is a default target i.e CLI or GUI, In Redhat GUI is default.

- /sbin/init	Finds all the drivers and to choose which OS

- on/root	To store root user/password, it is root file which store these.

- /etc/dracut.conf	Stores the Boot loader Information.
